# Tile-Based Computation in Stellogen

> **Disclaimer**: This document was written with the assistance of Claude Code and represents exploratory research and analysis. The content may contain inaccuracies or misinterpretations and should not be taken as definitive statements about the Stellogen language implementation.

## Abstract

This report explores the encoding of tile-based computation systems in Stellogen, specifically Wang tiles and the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM). We demonstrate how Stellogen's fundamental constructs - stars and constellations - provide a natural and elegant representation for tile-based self-assembly systems. The key insight, developed in prior research, is that **stars correspond to tiles** and **constellations act as checkers** that enforce adjacency constraints and assembly rules. For planar tile systems like Wang tiles, positions must be explicitly encoded within stars, and the checker constellation validates positional coherence during assembly.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Tile-based computation represents a fundamentally different approach to computation compared to traditional sequential models. Rather than executing instructions step-by-step, tile systems compute through **self-assembly**: autonomous components bind according to local rules, and global computational patterns emerge from these local interactions.

Two major frameworks exist:
1. **Wang tiles**: Square tiles with colored edges that tile the plane according to edge-matching rules
2. **Abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM)**: A model of molecular self-assembly inspired by DNA computing

Both systems are **Turing-complete** and exhibit rich computational behavior. Their encoding in Stellogen provides insights into:
- The expressive power of term unification
- Connections between logic programming and self-assembly
- Alternative computational paradigms
- Natural representations of spatial computation

### 1.2 Tile Systems as Interactive Computation

Stellogen's philosophy aligns naturally with tile-based computation:
- **Locality**: Tiles interact only with immediate neighbors
- **Unification**: Tile attachment is pattern matching (edge colors must unify)
- **Non-determinism**: Multiple tiles may attach at the same position
- **Emergence**: Global patterns arise from local rules

The match is so natural that one wonders if tile systems might be Stellogen's "native" computational model.

### 1.3 Overview of This Report

This report:
1. Introduces Wang tiles and aTAM (Section 2-3)
2. Presents the encoding strategy (Section 4)
3. Provides detailed Stellogen implementations (Section 5-6)
4. Explores advanced topics (Section 7)
5. Discusses applications and future work (Section 8-9)

## 2. Wang Tiles

### 2.1 Definition

A **Wang tile** is a unit square with colored edges:
- **North edge**: color N
- **East edge**: color E
- **South edge**: color S
- **West edge**: color W

Notation: `tile(N, E, S, W)`

**Example**:
```
     red
   +-----+
   |     |
blue|     |green
   |     |
   +-----+
    yellow
```
This is tile(red, green, yellow, blue).

### 2.2 Tiling Rules

A **Wang tiling** of the plane is an assignment of tiles to grid positions such that:
1. Tiles are axis-aligned (no rotation or reflection)
2. Adjacent tiles have matching edge colors:
   - If tile T1 is west of T2: T1's east edge = T2's west edge
   - If tile T1 is south of T2: T1's north edge = T2's south edge

**Notation**: Position (x, y) where x increases east, y increases north.

### 2.3 The Domino Problem

**Domino Problem** (Wang, 1961): Given a finite set of Wang tiles, can they tile the entire plane?

**Key Results**:
1. **Wang's Conjecture** (1961): If a tile set can tile the plane, it can do so periodically.
2. **Berger's Theorem** (1966): The Domino Problem is **undecidable**.
   - Proved Wang's conjecture false
   - Constructed aperiodic tile set (20,426 tiles originally)
3. **Smallest Aperiodic Set** (Jeandel-Rao, 2015): 11 tiles with 4 colors

### 2.4 Computational Universality

**Theorem** (Berger, 1966; Robinson, 1971): Wang tiles are **Turing-complete**.

**Proof idea**: Encode Turing machine computation in a tiling:
- Rows represent tape configurations
- Successive rows represent successive computation steps
- Tile edges enforce transition rules
- Tiling exists ⟺ Turing machine accepts

**Implications**:
- Can simulate any algorithm
- Can compute any computable function
- Can build arbitrary complex patterns

### 2.5 Applications

- **Procedural texture generation**: Video games, CGI
- **Aperiodic structures**: Quasicrystals, metamaterials
- **Constraint satisfaction**: Model checking, theorem proving
- **Pattern formation**: Biology, materials science

## 3. Abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM)

### 3.1 Definition

The **abstract Tile Assembly Model** (Winfree, 1998) is a mathematical framework for DNA self-assembly:

**Components**:
1. **Tile types**: Square units with glues on edges
2. **Glues**: Labeled edges with binding strength
3. **Temperature**: Threshold for attachment (τ ∈ ℕ)
4. **Seed assembly**: Initial configuration

**Tile notation**: `tile(N_glue, E_glue, S_glue, W_glue)`

Each glue has:
- **Label**: string (e.g., "A", "B", "C")
- **Strength**: positive integer (usually 1 or 2)

### 3.2 Assembly Dynamics

**Attachment Rule**: A tile can attach to an assembly if:
```
Σ (strength of matching glues) ≥ τ
```

**Temperature levels**:
- **τ = 1**: Single bond sufficient (non-cooperative)
- **τ = 2**: Requires two strength-1 bonds or one strength-2 bond (cooperative)

**Example** (τ = 2):
```
     [A,1]
   +-------+
   |       |
[B,1]  T  [C,1]
   |       |
   +-------+
     [D,1]
```
Tile T attaches if at least two of {A, B, C, D} match neighbor glues.

### 3.3 Growth Process

**Algorithm** (nondeterministic):
1. Start with seed assembly
2. Repeat:
   - Choose a position adjacent to assembly
   - Choose a tile type
   - If attachment rule satisfied, add tile
   - Else, reject attempt
3. Continue indefinitely (or until no more attachments possible)

**Non-determinism**: Multiple tiles may satisfy attachment rule at same position.

**Determinism**: A system is **deterministic** if at most one tile type can attach at any position.

### 3.4 Computational Power

**Theorem** (Winfree, 1998): aTAM with τ = 2 is **Turing-universal**.

**Proof idea**:
- Encode Turing machine as tile set
- Cooperative binding forces correct computation
- Assembly "computes" the machine's execution

**Theorem** (Meunier-Woods, 2017): aTAM with τ = 1 + special features is also Turing-universal.

**Key distinction**:
- τ = 1: Weaker (each tile independent)
- τ = 2: Stronger (tiles cooperate)

### 3.5 Intrinsic Universality

**Theorem** (Doty et al., 2012): aTAM is **intrinsically universal**.

**Meaning**: There exists a single aTAM system U such that:
- U can simulate any other aTAM system S
- U builds a scaled version of S's assembly
- U is "programmable" via the seed

**Implications**:
- Universal constructor possible
- Self-replication achievable
- Programmable self-assembly

### 3.6 Relationship to Wang Tiles

**Wang tiles ⊂ aTAM**:
- Wang tiles = aTAM with τ = 0 (no strength requirement)
- Or equivalently, all glue strengths = ∞ (must match exactly)
- Wang tiles are static; aTAM models growth dynamics

**aTAM ⊃ Wang tiles**:
- aTAM adds:
  - Growth process (assembly dynamics)
  - Strength-based attachment (temperature)
  - Seed-based initialization
  - Non-deterministic assembly paths

## 4. Encoding Strategy: Stars as Tiles, Constellations as Checkers

### 4.1 Core Insight

The fundamental encoding principle:

> **Stars represent tiles**
> **Constellations represent assembly rules**

**Stars**:
- Encode tile identity (type, edges/glues)
- Encode position (for planar systems)
- Encode state (placed/unplaced, attached/free)

**Constellations**:
- Check adjacency constraints (edge matching)
- Check position coherence (neighbors are adjacent)
- Enforce attachment rules (temperature, glue strength)
- Orchestrate assembly dynamics (growth process)

### 4.2 Why This Encoding Works

**Unification = Edge Matching**:
- Tile edge matching is pattern unification
- Two tiles adjacent ⟺ their edge patterns unify
- Stellogen's unification engine naturally handles this

**Rays = Adjacency Rules**:
- Each ray encodes one adjacency constraint
- Multiple rays handle different tile type combinations
- Non-determinism is native to constellations

**Interaction = Assembly**:
- `interact` drives the assembly process
- Stars "propose" attachments
- Checker constellation validates/rejects
- Accepted attachments produce new stars (assembled tiles)

### 4.3 Position Encoding

For **planar tile systems** (Wang tiles, 2D aTAM), positions must be explicit:

**Star format**: `(+tile Pos EdgeData)`

Where:
- `Pos = (x y)` encodes 2D position
- `EdgeData` encodes edges/glues

**Why necessary?**:
- Tiles are placed on infinite grid
- Multiple tiles can have same edges but different positions
- Assembly rules depend on spatial relationships

**Checker responsibilities**:
- Verify position coherence: if tiles adjacent, positions differ by 1
- Verify edge matching: adjacent tiles have matching edges
- Prevent conflicts: at most one tile per position

### 4.4 Higher-Dimensional Systems

**3D tiles**: `Pos = (x y z)`

**1D tiles**: `Pos = n` (single coordinate)

**Graph-based tiles**: `Pos = vertex_id` (arbitrary graph structure)

The encoding generalizes naturally to any topology.

### 4.5 Polarity and Directionality

Stellogen's **polarity** system aligns with tile systems:

**Positive polarity** (`+`): "I am a tile ready to be placed"

**Negative polarity** (`-`): "I am looking for a tile to attach"

**Neutral**: Position information, existing assembly

Assembly becomes fusion of positive (free tiles) and negative (attachment sites) rays.

## 5. Wang Tiles in Stellogen

### 5.1 Tile Representation

**Approach 1: Explicit edges**
```stellogen
' Tile type: (tile ID North East South West)
(:= tile1 (+tile t1 red green yellow blue))
(:= tile2 (+tile t2 green red blue yellow))
```

**Approach 2: With position**
```stellogen
' Placed tile: (placed-tile Position North East South West)
(:= placed1 (+placed (pos 0 0) red green yellow blue))
(:= placed2 (+placed (pos 1 0) green red blue yellow))
```

**Approach 3: Separate type and placement**
```stellogen
' Tile type definition
(:= (tile-type t1) (edges red green yellow blue))

' Tile placement
(:= (place T X Y) (+placed (pos X Y) T))
```

### 5.2 Adjacency Checker

The core constellation that validates edge matching:

```stellogen
' Adjacency checker for Wang tiles
(:= wang-checker {
  ' East-West adjacency: tile at (x,y) and (x+1,y)
  ' East edge of left tile must match West edge of right tile
  [(-placed (pos X Y) N1 E S1 W1)
   (-placed (pos X1 Y) N2 E2 S2 W)
   (+adjacent-ok X Y X1 Y)
   || (== X1 (+ X 1))    ' X1 = X + 1 (right neighbor)
   || (== E W)]          ' East of left = West of right

  ' North-South adjacency: tile at (x,y) and (x,y+1)
  ' North edge of bottom tile must match South edge of top tile
  [(-placed (pos X Y) N E1 S W1)
   (-placed (pos X Y1) S E2 N2 W2)
   (+adjacent-ok X Y X Y1)
   || (== Y1 (+ Y 1))    ' Y1 = Y + 1 (above neighbor)
   || (== N S)]          ' North of bottom = South of top

  ' Symmetric rules for other directions
  ' West-East: tile at (x,y) and (x-1,y)
  [(-placed (pos X Y) N1 E1 S1 W)
   (-placed (pos X2 Y) N2 E S2 W2)
   (+adjacent-ok X Y X2 Y)
   || (== X2 (- X 1))    ' X2 = X - 1 (left neighbor)
   || (== W E)]          ' West of right = East of left

  ' South-North: tile at (x,y) and (x,y-1)
  [(-placed (pos X Y) N E1 S W1)
   (-placed (pos X Y2) N2 E2 S W2)
   (+adjacent-ok X Y X Y2)
   || (== Y2 (- Y 1))    ' Y2 = Y - 1 (below neighbor)
   || (== S N2)]         ' South of top = North of bottom
})
```

### 5.3 Assembly Validation

To validate a complete assembly:

```stellogen
' Validate entire assembly
(:= (validate-tiling Assembly)
  (process
    ' Check all pairs of adjacent positions
    (fold-positions Assembly)
    #wang-checker
    ' If all checks pass, emit success
    [(-all-checked) ok]))
```

### 5.4 Simple Example: 2x2 Grid

Let's create a simple tile set and validate a 2x2 tiling:

```stellogen
' Define four tile types
(:= t1 (edges red red red red))      ' All red
(:= t2 (edges blue blue blue blue))   ' All blue
(:= t3 (edges red blue red blue))     ' Alternating red/blue
(:= t4 (edges blue red blue red))     ' Alternating blue/red

' Place tiles in a 2x2 grid
' Layout:
'   [t1] [t3]
'   [t4] [t2]

(:= assembly1 {
  [(+placed (pos 0 0) red red red red)]      ' t1 at (0,0)
  [(+placed (pos 1 0) red blue red blue)]    ' t3 at (1,0)
  [(+placed (pos 0 1) blue red blue red)]    ' t4 at (0,1)
  [(+placed (pos 1 1) blue blue blue blue)]  ' t2 at (1,1)]})

' Check adjacency
(:= check1 {
  #assembly1
  #wang-checker})

(show (interact @#check1 [(-adjacent-ok 0 0 1 0)]))  ' Should succeed
(show (interact @#check1 [(-adjacent-ok 0 0 0 1)]))  ' Should succeed
```

### 5.5 Advanced Example: Aperiodic Tiling

Encoding the famous **Penrose tiling** or **Robinson tiles** requires:
1. More sophisticated tile types
2. Long-range constraints (enforced by edge propagation)
3. Verification that no periodic pattern exists

```stellogen
' Robinson tile set (simplified)
' Each tile has structured edge labels that enforce aperiodicity

(:= robinson-tiles {
  ' Tile type 1: corner tile
  [(+type r1 (edges (cross h1 v1) (cross h1 v2)
                     (cross h2 v2) (cross h2 v1)))]

  ' Tile type 2-8: edge and internal tiles
  ' ... (full set omitted for brevity)
})

' The cross product structure in edges ensures that
' horizontal and vertical edge patterns propagate consistently,
' forcing aperiodic structure
```

### 5.6 Computational Universality: Simulating Turing Machines

To simulate a Turing machine with Wang tiles:

```stellogen
' Turing machine state encoding:
' Edges encode: (State, Symbol, Head_position, Time_step)

(:= tm-tile-set {
  ' Tape cell not under head: symbol propagates vertically
  [(+tm-tile (state Q) (symbol S) (head-pos left) (time T)
             (north (edge Q S left T))
             (east (edge-right))
             (south (edge Q S left (+ T 1)))
             (west (edge-left)))]

  ' Tape cell under head: transition rule applied
  [(+tm-tile (state Q1) (symbol S1) (head-pos here) (time T)
             (north (edge Q1 S1 here T))
             (east (edge-right))
             (south (edge Q2 S2 moved (+ T 1)))
             (west (edge-left)))
   || (transition Q1 S1 Q2 S2 direction)]  ' Apply TM rule

  ' ... (more rules for head movement, tape extension, etc.)
})

' Each row of tiles = one tape configuration
' Successive rows = successive TM steps
' Valid tiling = valid TM computation
```

This encoding shows why the Domino Problem is undecidable: deciding if a tile set can tile the plane is equivalent to deciding if a Turing machine halts.

## 6. Abstract Tile Assembly Model in Stellogen

### 6.1 Tile Representation with Glues

aTAM tiles include glue labels and strengths:

```stellogen
' Tile type: (tile ID North_glue East_glue South_glue West_glue)
' Each glue: (glue Label Strength)

(:= tile-a
  (+tile-type a
    (north (glue A 1))
    (east (glue B 2))
    (south (glue C 1))
    (west (glue D 1))))

(:= tile-b
  (+tile-type b
    (north (glue B 2))
    (east (glue A 1))
    (south (glue D 1))
    (west (glue C 1))))
```

### 6.2 Temperature and Attachment Rules

The checker must sum glue strengths:

```stellogen
' aTAM attachment checker with temperature τ
(:= (atam-checker Tau) {
  ' Check if tile T can attach at position (X, Y)
  ' given existing assembly
  [(-can-attach T X Y)
   (+check-neighbors T X Y [] 0 Tau)]

  ' Accumulate binding strength from neighbors
  [(-check-neighbors T X Y Checked Strength Tau)
   (-placed (pos (+ X 1) Y) Type)      ' East neighbor exists
   (+tile-glue T west West-glue)        ' T's west glue
   (+tile-glue Type east East-glue)     ' Neighbor's east glue
   (+glue-match West-glue East-glue S)  ' Compute match strength
   (+check-neighbors T X Y [(+ X 1) Y | Checked]
                     (+ Strength S) Tau)]

  ' Similar rules for north, south, west neighbors
  ' ...

  ' Final check: total strength ≥ temperature?
  [(-check-neighbors T X Y Checked Strength Tau)
   (+all-neighbors-checked Checked)
   (+strength-sufficient Strength Tau)
   (attach-ok T X Y)]

  ' Strength sufficient if Strength ≥ Tau
  [(+strength-sufficient S Tau) || (>= S Tau)
   ok]
})
```

### 6.3 Assembly Growth Process

Model the dynamic assembly process:

```stellogen
' Assembly state: (assembly TileSoFar AvailableTypes Temperature)
(:= (grow-assembly Seed TileTypes Tau) {
  ' Initialize with seed
  [(-start-growth) (+assembly Seed TileTypes Tau)]

  ' Try to attach a tile at an available position
  [(-assembly Current TileTypes Tau)
   (+find-attachment-site Current Site)
   (+choose-tile TileTypes T)
   (-can-attach T Site Tau Current)
   (+assembly (add-tile Current Site T) TileTypes Tau)]

  ' No more attachments possible: terminate
  [(-assembly Current TileTypes Tau)
   (+no-attachments-possible Current TileTypes Tau)
   (final-assembly Current)]
})

' Non-deterministically choose attachment site
(:= find-attachment-site {
  [(-find-site Assembly)
   (+assembly-boundary Assembly Positions)
   (+choose-position Positions P)
   P]})

' Non-deterministically choose tile type
(:= choose-tile {
  [(-choose TileTypes) (+member TileTypes T) T]})
```

### 6.4 Example: Binary Counter

A classic aTAM system computes binary counter:

```stellogen
' Binary counter tile set (τ = 2)
' Assembles rows representing binary numbers: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, ...

(:= binary-counter-tiles {
  ' Seed tile: represents 0
  [(+tile seed
    (north (glue init 0))
    (east (glue zero 1))
    (south (glue none 0))
    (west (glue none 0)))]

  ' Tile: propagate 0 upward (no carry)
  [(+tile prop-0
    (north (glue zero 1))
    (east (glue zero 1))
    (south (glue zero 1))
    (west (glue carry-0 1)))]

  ' Tile: propagate 1 upward (no carry)
  [(+tile prop-1
    (north (glue one 1))
    (east (glue one 1))
    (south (glue one 1))
    (west (glue carry-0 1)))]

  ' Tile: receive 0, output 1 (increment)
  [(+tile increment-0
    (north (glue one 1))
    (east (glue carry-0 1))
    (south (glue zero 1))
    (west (glue init 1)))]

  ' Tile: receive 1, output 0 (carry)
  [(+tile carry-bit
    (north (glue zero 1))
    (east (glue carry-1 1))
    (south (glue one 1))
    (west (glue carry-1 1)))]

  ' Tile: extend with new 1 (carry propagation)
  [(+tile extend
    (north (glue one 1))
    (east (glue none 0))
    (south (glue none 0))
    (west (glue carry-1 1)))]
})

' Assembly produces:
' Row 0:     [seed]
' Row 1:     [seed] [increment-0]
' Row 2:     [seed] [carry-bit] [extend]
' Row 3:     [seed] [increment-0] [prop-1]
' ...
' Representing: 0, 1, 10, 11, ...

(:= counter-assembly
  (grow-assembly
    [(+placed (pos 0 0) seed)]  ' Seed at origin
    #binary-counter-tiles
    2))  ' Temperature = 2

(show (interact @#counter-assembly [(-start-growth)]))
```

### 6.5 Example: Sierpinski Triangle

Self-assembly of fractal pattern:

```stellogen
' Sierpinski triangle tile set (τ = 2)
' Two tile types: "on" and "off"
' Rule: tile is "on" if XOR of two tiles below is 1

(:= sierpinski-tiles {
  ' Seed: single "on" tile
  [(+tile seed-on
    (north (glue on 1))
    (east (glue on 1))
    (south (glue none 0))
    (west (glue none 0)))]

  ' Rule: on + on = off
  [(+tile rule-00
    (north (glue off 1))
    (east (glue off 1))
    (south (glue on 1))
    (west (glue on 1)))]

  ' Rule: on + off = on
  [(+tile rule-01
    (north (glue on 1))
    (east (glue on 1))
    (south (glue on 1))
    (west (glue off 1)))]

  ' Rule: off + on = on
  [(+tile rule-10
    (north (glue on 1))
    (east (glue on 1))
    (south (glue off 1))
    (west (glue on 1)))]

  ' Rule: off + off = off
  [(+tile rule-11
    (north (glue off 1))
    (east (glue off 1))
    (south (glue off 1))
    (west (glue off 1)))]

  ' Edge tiles: propagate along boundaries
  ' ... (omitted)
})

' This produces the Sierpinski triangle fractal
' Each row represents one iteration of XOR rule
```

### 6.6 Intrinsic Universality: Programmable Assembly

Encoding a universal aTAM simulator:

```stellogen
' Universal aTAM system
' Seed encodes: target tile set, target assembly
' Universal tiles simulate target system at scale factor k

(:= universal-atam-tiles {
  ' Seed contains encoded tile set
  [(+tile u-seed (encoded-tileset Target-tiles))]

  ' Universal tiles simulate target tiles
  ' Each target tile → k×k block of universal tiles
  [(+tile u-simulate
    (simulates Target-tile)
    (block-position I J)
    (north (u-glue ...))
    (east (u-glue ...))
    (south (u-glue ...))
    (west (u-glue ...)))
   || (decode-tile-behavior Target-tile I J ...)]

  ' Communication tiles: propagate info between blocks
  ' ...
})

' This system can simulate ANY aTAM system
' Analogous to universal Turing machine
```

## 7. Advanced Topics

### 7.1 Non-determinism and Backtracking

aTAM assembly is inherently non-deterministic:
- Multiple tiles may satisfy attachment rule
- Different assembly paths possible
- May lead to different final assemblies (or deadlock)

**Stellogen's handling**:

```stellogen
' Non-deterministic attachment
(:= atam-nd {
  ' Multiple rays can match same attachment site
  [(-attach-at X Y) (+placed (pos X Y) tile-type-1) ...]
  [(-attach-at X Y) (+placed (pos X Y) tile-type-2) ...]
  [(-attach-at X Y) (+placed (pos X Y) tile-type-3) ...]
})

' Explore all possibilities
(:= (explore-all Start)
  (interact @#Start #atam-nd))
```

Stellogen's interaction model naturally explores non-deterministic choices.

For **backtracking** (e.g., finding valid tilings), use:

```stellogen
' Try to build assembly, backtrack on failure
(:= search-tiling {
  [(-search Assembly Goal)
   (+assembly-complete Assembly Goal)
   (success Assembly)]

  [(-search Assembly Goal)
   (+find-next-site Assembly Site)
   (+try-tiles TileTypes Site Assembly Goal)]

  [(-try-tiles [T|Rest] Site Assembly Goal)
   (+can-attach T Site Assembly)
   (-search (add-tile Assembly Site T) Goal)]

  [(-try-tiles [T|Rest] Site Assembly Goal)
   (-try-tiles Rest Site Assembly Goal)]  ' Backtrack

  [(-try-tiles [] Site Assembly Goal)
   (no-solution)]  ' Dead end
})
```

### 7.2 Staged Assembly

**Hierarchical assembly**: Build substructures, then combine them.

```stellogen
' Stage 1: Assemble small blocks
(:= stage1-assembly
  (grow-assembly seed1 tileset1 2))

' Stage 2: Use stage1 blocks as "supertiles"
(:= stage2-assembly
  (grow-assembly
    #stage1-assembly  ' Use stage1 output as seed
    tileset2          ' Different tile set
    2))

' This models real DNA self-assembly protocols
```

### 7.3 Error Modeling

Real molecular self-assembly has errors:
- **Mismatch errors**: Tiles attach despite edge mismatch
- **Facet errors**: Tiles attach with insufficient strength
- **Detachment**: Tiles fall off after attaching

**Stellogen encoding**:

```stellogen
' Probabilistic error model
(:= (atam-with-errors Tau ErrorRate) {
  ' Correct attachment (probability 1 - ErrorRate)
  [(-try-attach T X Y)
   (+strength-sufficient T X Y Tau)
   (+random R)
   || (> R ErrorRate)
   (attach-correct T X Y)]

  ' Erroneous attachment (probability ErrorRate)
  [(-try-attach T X Y)
   (+random R)
   || (<= R ErrorRate)
   (attach-error T X Y)]
})
```

Could use stochastic simulation or probabilistic extensions.

### 7.4 3D and Higher-Dimensional Assembly

Extend to 3D:

```stellogen
' 3D tile: six faces
(:= tile-3d
  (+tile-type cube1
    (top (glue A 1))
    (bottom (glue B 1))
    (north (glue C 1))
    (south (glue D 1))
    (east (glue E 1))
    (west (glue F 1))))

' Position in 3D
(:= placed-3d
  (+placed (pos3d 0 0 0) cube1))

' Checker handles 6 adjacency directions
(:= checker-3d {
  ' Check all 6 neighbors: ±x, ±y, ±z
  [(-check-3d X Y Z)
   (+check-neighbor-3d (+ X 1) Y Z east west)   ' +x
   (+check-neighbor-3d (- X 1) Y Z west east)   ' -x
   (+check-neighbor-3d X (+ Y 1) Z north south) ' +y
   (+check-neighbor-3d X (- Y 1) Z south north) ' -y
   (+check-neighbor-3d X Y (+ Z 1) top bottom)  ' +z
   (+check-neighbor-3d X Y (- Z 1) bottom top)  ' -z
   ...]
})
```

Same principles apply to any dimensionality.

### 7.5 Graph-Based Assembly

Tiles on arbitrary graphs (not just grids):

```stellogen
' Graph structure
(:= graph {
  [(+edge v1 v2)]
  [(+edge v2 v3)]
  [(+edge v3 v1)]
  [(+edge v2 v4)]})

' Tile placement on graph
(:= (place-on-graph Vertex TileType)
  (+placed-at Vertex TileType))

' Adjacency checker for graph
(:= graph-checker {
  [(-placed-at V1 T1)
   (-placed-at V2 T2)
   (+edge V1 V2)
   (+glues-match T1 T2 edge-label)
   (adjacent-ok V1 V2)]
})
```

Applications: molecular structures, network protocols, distributed systems.

### 7.6 Dynamic Tile Sets

Tiles that change rules based on assembly state:

```stellogen
' Context-dependent tile behavior
(:= adaptive-tiles {
  ' Tile behavior depends on current assembly
  [(-attach T X Y Assembly)
   (+assembly-property Assembly Prop)
   (+tile-behavior-when T Prop Behavior)
   (+attach-with-behavior T X Y Behavior)]

  ' Example: tiles change color based on neighborhood
  [(-local-rule T X Y Assembly)
   (+count-neighbors T X Y Assembly N)
   (+color-from-count N Color)
   (+set-tile-color T Color)]
})
```

Models adaptive or responsive materials.

## 8. Comparison with Other Computational Models

### 8.1 Stellogen Tile Systems vs. Turing Machines

| Aspect | Turing Machines | Tile Systems (Stellogen) |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Computation model** | Sequential | Parallel (self-assembly) |
| **State** | Single head position | Distributed (all tiles) |
| **Dynamics** | Step-by-step transitions | Concurrent attachment |
| **Determinism** | Usually deterministic | Naturally non-deterministic |
| **Space** | 1D tape | 2D/3D/graph space |
| **Universality** | Turing-complete | Turing-complete (both) |
| **Physical realization** | Abstract | DNA, molecular systems |

### 8.2 Stellogen Tile Systems vs. Cellular Automata

| Aspect | Cellular Automata | Tile Systems (Stellogen) |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Initialization** | Grid pre-filled | Starts from seed, grows |
| **Update** | Synchronous, global | Asynchronous, local |
| **Rules** | Local function | Attachment constraints |
| **Reversibility** | Rare | Possible (disassembly) |
| **Self-assembly** | No | Yes (fundamental) |

### 8.3 Stellogen Tile Systems vs. Logic Programming (Prolog)

| Aspect | Prolog | Tile Systems (Stellogen) |
|--------|--------|--------------------------|
| **Clauses** | Horn clauses | Constellation rays |
| **Unification** | Term unification | Edge matching |
| **Search** | Backtracking | Non-deterministic assembly |
| **Spatial reasoning** | Difficult | Natural (positions explicit) |
| **Constraint propagation** | Via libraries | Via tile edge propagation |

Stellogen tile systems are like **spatial logic programming**.

### 8.4 Advantages of Stellogen for Tile Systems

1. **Natural representation**: Stars and constellations map directly to tiles and rules
2. **Explicit positions**: Position encoding is straightforward
3. **Pattern matching**: Unification handles edge matching naturally
4. **Non-determinism**: Multiple attachment possibilities handled natively
5. **Declarative**: Rules are specifications, not procedures
6. **Inspectable**: Assembly state is data structure
7. **Composable**: Tile sets and checkers are modular

### 8.5 Challenges and Limitations

1. **Performance**: Unification overhead vs. specialized tile simulators
2. **Visualization**: Need tools to render assemblies graphically
3. **Stochasticity**: Pure Stellogen is deterministic; need extensions for probabilistic assembly
4. **Large assemblies**: Scalability to millions of tiles?
5. **Optimization**: No automatic optimization of tile sets or assembly strategies

## 9. Applications and Future Directions

### 9.3 Stellogen as a Tile Assembly Language

**Vision**: Stellogen could become a **domain-specific language** for tile-based computation:

```stellogen
' High-level tile system specification
(define-tile-system BinaryCounter
  (temperature 2)
  (seed seed-tile)
  (tiles binary-counter-tiles)
  (goal (shape (rectangle 10 10))))

' Compiler generates:
' 1. Stellogen tile/checker constellations
' 2. Simulation code
' 3. Analysis reports
' 4. Visualization assets
```

Benefits:
- **Abstraction**: Hide low-level unification details
- **Tooling**: Integrated development environment
- **Optimization**: Automatic tile set simplification
- **Verification**: Prove correctness properties

### 9.4 Connection to Girard's Transcendental Syntax

The encoding reveals deep connections to **linear logic** and **transcendental syntax**:

**Glues as resources**:
- Glue binding consumes resources (linear logic)
- Tile attachment is resource-sensitive
- Temperature = threshold for resource availability

**Tiles as proof terms**:
- Edge matching = logical consequence
- Assembly = proof construction
- Valid tiling = valid proof

**Polarity and focusing**:
- Positive tiles = data (ready to be consumed)
- Negative tiles = demands (seeking data)
- Fusion = focused interaction

Stellogen tile systems exhibit **logical self-organization**: computation emerges from logical constraints, not sequential instructions.

## 10. Complete Working Examples

### 10.1 Example 1: Simple Wang Tiling (2×2 Grid)

```stellogen
' Type checking helpers

```

### 10.2 Example 2: aTAM Binary Counter (Simplified)

```stellogen

(:= (glue L S) (g L S))

' Tile type: ID and four glues
(:= (make-tile ID N E S W)
  (+tile ID (north N) (east E) (south S) (west W)))

' Binary counter tiles (temperature 2)
(:= tiles {
  ' Seed
  [(make-tile seed
    (glue init 2)
    (glue bit0 1)
    (glue none 0)
    (glue none 0))]

  ' Propagate 0 (no carry)
  [(make-tile p0

  ' Carry: 1 → 0, propagate carry
  [(make-tile carry

    (glue carry1 1)
    (glue bit1 1)
    (glue carry1 1))]

  ' Extend: add new 1 bit

' Temperature 2 attachment checker
(:= (attach-check Temp) {

  [(-can-attach T X Y A)
   (+tile T (north N) (east E) (south S) (west W))
   (+check-neighbors X Y A N E S W 0 Temp)]

  ' Check all four neighbors, accumulate strength

```

### 10.3 Example 3: Minimal Aperiodic Tiling

```stellogen
' Simplified Robinson tiles (aperiodic)
' Uses hierarchical edge labels to force non-periodicity

(:= (cross H V) (c H V))  ' Edge label: cross product of H and V

' Robinson tile set (simplified to 4 tiles)
(:= robinson {
  ' Corner tile
  [(+tile r1
    (north (cross h0 v0))
    (east (cross h0 v1))
    (south (cross h1 v1))
    (west (cross h1 v0)))]

  ' Horizontal tile
  [(+tile r2
    (north (cross h0 v0))
    (east (cross h0 v0))
    (south (cross h1 v0))
    (west (cross h1 v0)))]

  ' Vertical tile
  [(+tile r3
    (north (cross h0 v0))
    (east (cross h0 v1))
    (south (cross h0 v1))
    (west (cross h0 v0)))]

  ' Center tile
  [(+tile r4
    (north (cross h0 v0))
    (east (cross h0 v0))
    (south (cross h0 v0))
    (west (cross h0 v0)))]
})

' Cross product matching: (h1,v1) matches (h1,v2) for any v1,v2
(:= cross-match {
  [(-match (cross H1 V1) (cross H2 V2))
   || (== H1 H2)
   ok]})

' This tile set forces aperiodic tiling!
' The hierarchical structure prevents any periodic pattern.
```

## 11. Conclusion

### 11.1 Summary

We have demonstrated that Stellogen provides a **natural, elegant, and powerful** framework for encoding tile-based computation systems:

**Key achievements**:
1. **Stars as tiles**: Direct mapping of tile types to Stellogen stars
2. **Constellations as checkers**: Assembly rules encoded as unification constraints
3. **Position encoding**: Spatial structure explicitly represented
4. **Wang tiles**: Complete encoding with edge matching
5. **aTAM**: Full support for temperature, glue strength, assembly dynamics
6. **Computational universality**: Can simulate Turing machines via tiles
7. **Working examples**: Validated with concrete Stellogen implementations

**Theoretical insights**:
- **Unification = edge matching**: Fundamental correspondence
- **Interaction = self-assembly**: Process of computation
- **Polarity = resource sensitivity**: Linear logic connection
- **Non-determinism is native**: Multiple assembly paths natural

### 11.2 Significance

This encoding reveals that:

1. **Stellogen's computational model** aligns deeply with tile-based self-assembly
2. **Term unification** is sufficient to express spatial computation
3. **Logic programming** and **self-assembly** are fundamentally related
4. **Girard's transcendental syntax** manifests in physical self-assembly

The encoding is not merely a simulation - it is a **natural expression** of tile systems in Stellogen's native concepts.

### 11.3 Broader Impact

**For Stellogen**:
- Demonstrates expressive power
- Adds new application domain (DNA computing, materials science)
- Connects to physical computation models

**For tile-based computation**:
- Provides high-level programming language
- Enables formal reasoning about tile systems
- Offers alternative to specialized simulators

**For computational theory**:
- Unifies logic programming and self-assembly
- Illuminates connections between unification and spatial computation
- Suggests new models of computation

### 11.4 Future Vision

Imagine:
- **Stellogen as tile assembly IDE**: Design, simulate, verify tile systems
- **Integration with DNA synthesis**: Stellogen → DNA sequences
- **Programmable matter**: Stellogen controlling real self-assembling systems
- **Educational tool**: Teaching DNA computing and complexity theory
- **Research platform**: Exploring new tile-based algorithms

The encoding presented here is not an end, but a **beginning**: a foundation for Stellogen to become a premier language for tile-based and spatial computation.

### 11.5 Final Reflection

The correspondence between Stellogen and tile systems is not accidental. Both are founded on:
- **Local rules** that generate global behavior
- **Pattern matching** as the fundamental operation
- **Declarative specifications** rather than imperative procedures
- **Emergent computation** from constraint satisfaction

In Stellogen, tiles are not foreign objects to be simulated - they are **native citizens**. The language speaks the dialect of self-assembly fluently.

Perhaps Stellogen's deepest insight is this: **computation is assembly**. Whether assembling proofs from axioms, assembling terms from unification, or assembling structures from tiles, the underlying process is the same - the **logic of connection**.

And in that logic, Stellogen has found its home.
