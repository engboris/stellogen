## Introduction

### The Problem Statement

While Stellogen can reproduce many Prolog patterns (unification, relational programming, logic queries), it **cannot reproduce the behavior of Prolog's cut operator (`!`)**. This limitation stems from a fundamental architectural difference:

- **Prolog:** Clauses are **ordered** and evaluated with **backtracking search**
- **Stellogen:** Constellations are **unordered sets** and use **polarity-based interaction**

This document analyzes:
1. What cut does and why it matters
2. Why Stellogen's architecture makes cut impossible
3. Whether Stellogen needs cut, and if so, how to achieve similar control flow while staying true to its philosophy

### Stellogen's Philosophy

From the README and CLAUDE.md:

> Stellogen offers elementary interactive building blocks where both computation and meaning live in the same language... The semantic power (and the responsibility that comes with it) belongs entirely to the user.

**Key principles:**
- **Minimalism:** Small set of primitives, emergent complexity
- **Explicit control:** User controls evaluation via `@`, `#`, `interact`, `fire`, `process`
- **Logic-agnostic:** No imposed paradigm or control flow
- **Local behavior:** Elementary interactions without global coordination

Any solution must align with these principles.

## Prolog's Cut Operator

### What is Cut?

The **cut operator** (`!`) in Prolog is a control flow primitive that:

1. **Commits to the current clause**: Once a cut is executed, Prolog commits to that clause and will not backtrack to try alternative clauses
2. **Removes choice points**: Prevents backtracking past the cut
3. **Prunes the search tree**: Makes computation deterministic by eliminating branches

### Syntax and Semantics

**Basic syntax:**

```prolog
predicate(Args) :- condition1, condition2, !, action.
predicate(Args) :- alternative_clause.
```

**Semantics:**

```
When predicate(Args) is called:
1. Try the first clause
2. If condition1 and condition2 succeed:
   - Execute the cut (!)
   - Commit to this clause (remove all choice points)
   - Execute action
   - Succeed
3. If conditions fail BEFORE the cut:
   - Backtrack to try alternative_clause
4. If conditions fail AFTER the cut:
   - Fail without trying alternative_clause
```

### Example 1: Deterministic Max

**Without cut:**

```prolog
max(X, Y, X) :- X >= Y.
max(X, Y, Y) :- Y > X.

?- max(5, 3, R).
R = 5 ;        % First solution
R = 3.         % Backtracking gives second solution (wrong!)
```

**With cut:**

```prolog
max(X, Y, X) :- X >= Y, !.
max(X, Y, Y).

?- max(5, 3, R).
R = 5.         % Only solution (correct!)
```

The cut ensures that once we determine `X >= Y`, we commit to the first clause and never try the second.

### Example 2: Negation as Failure

**Implementing `not` using cut:**

```prolog
not(Goal) :- Goal, !, fail.
not(_).

% Usage
?- not(member(4, [1,2,3])).
true.

?- not(member(2, [1,2,3])).
false.
```

**How it works:**

1. `not(Goal)` first tries to prove `Goal`
2. If `Goal` succeeds:
   - Execute cut (commit to first clause)
   - Execute `fail` (fail the entire `not(Goal)`)
3. If `Goal` fails:
   - Backtrack to second clause: `not(_)` (succeed immediately)

### Example 3: If-Then-Else

```prolog
if_then_else(Condition, Then, _Else) :-
    Condition, !, Then.
if_then_else(_, _Then, Else) :-
    Else.

% Usage
?- if_then_else(5 > 3, write('yes'), write('no')).
yes
true.
```

### Example 4: Optimization (Memoization Pattern)

```prolog
% Fibonacci with memoization
fib(0, 0) :- !.
fib(1, 1) :- !.
fib(N, F) :-
    N > 1,
    N1 is N - 1,
    N2 is N - 2,
    fib(N1, F1),
    fib(N2, F2),
    F is F1 + F2.
```

The cuts in the base cases prevent unnecessary backtracking, improving performance.

### Example 5: Committed Choice (First Match)

```prolog
classify(X, negative) :- X < 0, !.
classify(X, zero) :- X =:= 0, !.
classify(X, positive) :- X > 0, !.

?- classify(-5, C).
C = negative.
% No backtracking to try other clauses
```

---

## Why Cut is Important

### 1. Determinism

**Problem:** Many predicates have a unique logical answer, but Prolog's backtracking produces spurious alternatives.

**Example:**

```prolog
% Without cut - non-deterministic
greater(X, Y) :- X > Y.
greater(X, Y) :- X =:= Y, fail.

?- greater(5, 3).
true ;        % Correct
false.        % Why try again?

% With cut - deterministic
greater(X, Y) :- X > Y, !.
greater(_, _) :- fail.

?- greater(5, 3).
true.         % Single answer
```

Cut makes the predicate **deterministic** when appropriate.

### 2. Efficiency

**Problem:** Backtracking explores unnecessary branches, wasting computation.

**Example - List membership:**

```prolog
% Without cut - checks entire list even after finding element
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).

?- member(a, [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j]).
true ;        % Found at position 1
true ;        % Found at position 1 (again? no...)
...           % Actually, standard member doesn't duplicate
              % but more complex examples do

% With cut - stops after first success
member_once(X, [X|_]) :- !.
member_once(X, [_|T]) :- member_once(X, T).

?- member_once(a, [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j]).
true.         % Found, stop immediately
```

Cut **prunes the search tree**, avoiding redundant computation.

### 3. Implementing Negation

**Problem:** Prolog doesn't have built-in negation (NAF - negation as failure).

**Solution:** Implement using cut:

```prolog
not(Goal) :- Goal, !, fail.
not(_).
```

This is so common that Prolog provides `\+` as syntactic sugar for it.

### 4. If-Then-Else

**Problem:** Need conditional execution without backtracking.

**Solution:**

```prolog
if_then_else(Cond, Then, _) :- Cond, !, Then.
if_then_else(_, _, Else) :- Else.
```

Prolog provides `(Cond -> Then ; Else)` as syntactic sugar.

### 5. Mutual Exclusion

**Problem:** Only one of several alternatives should be tried.

**Example:**

```prolog
process(small_file) :- size(S), S < 1000, !, fast_algo.
process(medium_file) :- size(S), S < 10000, !, medium_algo.
process(large_file) :- slow_algo.
```

Cut ensures that once we classify the file size, we don't try other algorithms.

### 6. Breaking Infinite Loops

**Problem:** Some recursive predicates can loop infinitely during backtracking.

**Example:**

```prolog
% Without cut - may loop
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y).

% With cut in base case - more controlled
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y), !.
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y).
```

### Summary: Why Cut Matters

| Use Case | Without Cut | With Cut |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Determinism** | Spurious alternatives | Single answer when appropriate |
| **Efficiency** | Explores unnecessary branches | Prunes search tree |
| **Negation** | Cannot express | `not(Goal) :- Goal, !, fail.` |
| **Conditionals** | Cumbersome | Natural if-then-else |
| **Mutual exclusion** | All alternatives tried | First match commits |
| **Performance** | O(n) or worse | Often O(1) or O(log n) |

**Cut is essential for writing practical Prolog programs.**

## Why Stellogen Cannot Reproduce Cut

### Architectural Difference

The fundamental issue is that **Prolog and Stellogen have incompatible computational models**:

| Aspect | Prolog | Stellogen |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Structure** | Ordered clauses | Unordered constellations |
| **Evaluation** | Sequential backtracking search | Parallel polarity interaction |
| **Choice points** | Implicit (automatic) | None |
| **Control** | Cut removes choice points | No choice points to remove |
| **Semantics** | Try clauses in order until success | All matching stars interact |

### Problem 1: No Clause Ordering

**Prolog:**

```prolog
max(X, Y, X) :- X >= Y, !.   % Clause 1 (tried first)
max(X, Y, Y).                 % Clause 2 (tried second)
```

Clauses are **ordered**. The cut says "don't try clause 2 if we've reached this point in clause 1."

**Stellogen:**

```stellogen
(:= max {
  [(-max X Y X) || (>= X Y)]
  [(-max X Y Y)]})
```

Stars are an **unordered set**. There's no "first" or "second" to commit to.

### Problem 2: No Backtracking

**Prolog:**

```prolog
?- member(X, [1,2,3]).
X = 1 ;        % First solution
X = 2 ;        % Backtrack to find more
X = 3.         % Backtrack again
```

Prolog maintains a **choice point** at each clause. Backtracking explores alternatives.

**Stellogen:**

```stellogen
(:= member {
  [(+member X [X|_])]
  [(-member X [_|T]) (+member X T)]})

(:= query [(-member X [1 2 3]) X])
(show (interact #member @#query))
' Result: [1, 2, 3]  (all at once, or depends on implementation)
```

Stellogen has **no backtracking mechanism**. All matching interactions happen together (with `interact`) or are consumed linearly (with `fire`).

### Problem 3: No Sequential Evaluation

**Prolog:**

```prolog
process(X) :- small(X), !, fast_process.
process(X) :- medium(X), !, medium_process.
process(X) :- slow_process.
```

Clauses are tried **sequentially** until one succeeds.

**Stellogen:**

```stellogen
(:= process {
  [(-process X) (+small X) fast_process]
  [(-process X) (+medium X) medium_process]
  [(-process X) slow_process]})
```

All stars in the constellation exist simultaneously. There's no concept of "try this first, then that."

### Problem 4: No Choice Point Manipulation

**Prolog's cut semantics:**

```
1. Create choice point when entering a clause
2. If cut is executed, remove choice point
3. Prevent backtracking past that point
```

**Stellogen:**

- No choice points created
- No backtracking mechanism
- Nothing for a cut-like operator to manipulate

### Concrete Example: Max Function

**Prolog (with cut):**

```prolog
max(X, Y, X) :- X >= Y, !.
max(X, Y, Y).

?- max(5, 3, R).
R = 5.         % Deterministic
```

**Attempted Stellogen translation:**

```stellogen
(:= max {
  [(-max X Y X) || (>= X Y)]
  [(-max X Y Y)]})

(:= query [(-max 5 3 R) R])
(show (interact #max @#query))
```

**Problem:** Both stars might match (or neither, depending on constraint handling). There's no way to say "if the first matches, don't try the second."

### The Fundamental Incompatibility

**Prolog's cut requires:**
1. Ordered clauses (first, second, third, ...)
2. Backtracking mechanism (try alternatives)
3. Choice points (save state for backtracking)
4. Sequential evaluation (try clauses one by one)

**Stellogen provides:**
1. Unordered constellations (no first/second)
2. Interaction-based evaluation (no backtracking)
3. No choice points (no state to save)
4. Parallel or linear fusion (not sequential)

**These are fundamentally incompatible.** You can't add cut to Stellogen without fundamentally changing its computational model.

## What Stellogen CAN Do

While Stellogen can't reproduce Prolog's cut, it has **different mechanisms** for controlling evaluation:

### 1. Explicit Focus (`@`)

**Control when terms are evaluated:**

```stellogen
(:= x (+f a))
#x         ' Just the identifier (unevaluated)
@#x        ' Evaluated before use
```

**Prolog equivalent:** None (evaluation is always automatic)

**Power:** You control **when** computation happens, not Prolog.

### 2. Linear vs Non-Linear Interaction

**`interact`:** Non-linear, all stars can be reused

```stellogen
(:= facts {
  [(+f 1)]
  [(+f 2)]})

(:= query [(-f X) (-f Y) (result X Y)])

(interact #facts @#query)
' All combinations: (result 1 1), (result 1 2), (result 2 1), (result 2 2)
```

**`fire`:** Linear, stars are consumed (like resources in linear logic)

```stellogen
(fire #facts @#query)
' Only consumes each fact once: (result 1 2) or (result 2 1)
```

**Power:** Control **whether** stars can be reused, affecting how many solutions are produced.

### 3. Process Chaining

**Chain constellations in sequence:**

```stellogen
(process
  #step1
  #step2
  #step3)
```

**Equivalent to Prolog's sequencing:** `step1, step2, step3`

**Power:** Explicit sequencing of computational steps.

### 4. Inequality Constraints

**Prevent certain unifications:**

```stellogen
(:= example {
  [(+f a)]
  [(+f b)]
  @[(-f X) (-f Y) (result X Y) || (!= X Y)]})
```

The constraint `|| (!= X Y)` ensures `X` and `Y` are different.

**Prolog equivalent:** `X \= Y` or `dif(X, Y)`

**Power:** Declarative constraints on unification.

### 5. Explicit Conditionals via Guards

**Use constraints as guards:**

```stellogen
(:= classify {
  [(-classify X negative) || (< X 0)]
  [(-classify X zero) || (== X 0)]
  [(-classify X positive) || (> X 0)]})
```

**Prolog equivalent:**

```prolog
classify(X, negative) :- X < 0.
classify(X, zero) :- X =:= 0.
classify(X, positive) :- X > 0.
```

**Difference:** In Prolog, you'd use cut to make this deterministic:

```prolog
classify(X, negative) :- X < 0, !.
classify(X, zero) :- X =:= 0, !.
classify(X, positive) :- X > 0, !.
```

In Stellogen, all matching stars coexist—there's no commitment mechanism.

### 6. Controlled Failure

**Use `fire` for first-match semantics:**

```stellogen
' With fire, the first matching star consumes the query
(fire #classify @#query)
```

**Limitation:** This doesn't give you control over **which** star matches first (since the constellation is unordered).

---

## Potential Solutions

Given that Stellogen cannot (and should not) adopt Prolog's cut directly, what **can** we do to achieve similar control flow while maintaining Stellogen's philosophy?

### Solution 1: Priority/Ordering Annotations (Explicit Ordering)

**Idea:** Allow users to explicitly annotate stars with priorities or orderings when needed.

**Syntax:**

```stellogen
(:= classify {
  @priority(1) [(-classify X negative) || (< X 0)]
  @priority(2) [(-classify X zero) || (== X 0)]
  @priority(3) [(-classify X positive) || (> X 0)]})
```

Or with explicit ordering:

```stellogen
(:= max {
  @first [(-max X Y X) || (>= X Y)]
  @second [(-max X Y Y)]})
```

**Semantics:**

- When multiple stars match, try them in priority order
- Once a star succeeds, **optionally** commit to it (no further tries)

**Pros:**
- Gives users control over ordering when needed
- Explicit (users must request it)
- Doesn't change core semantics for unmarked constellations

**Cons:**
- Adds complexity
- Conflicts with "unordered set" philosophy
- Need to define what "success" means for commitment

**Alignment with philosophy:** ⚠️ Moderate

- Explicit control ✓
- Minimal ✗ (adds new annotation system)
- Logic-agnostic ✓ (user chooses when to use)

### Solution 2: First-Match Operator (Deterministic Fire)

**Idea:** Add a new interaction mode that commits to the first matching star.

**Syntax:**

```stellogen
(fire-first #constellation @#query)
```

**Semantics:**

- Try stars in implementation-defined order (e.g., definition order in source)
- Use the first star that matches
- Commit to that star (no further attempts)

**Example:**

```stellogen
(:= max {
  [(-max X Y X) || (>= X Y)]
  [(-max X Y Y)]})

(fire-first #max @#query)
' Uses first matching star
```

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement
- Doesn't require annotations
- Gives deterministic behavior

**Cons:**
- Relies on source order (implicit)
- Breaks "unordered set" principle
- What's the order in composite constellations? `{ #a #b }`

**Alignment with philosophy:** ⚠️ Moderate

- Explicit control ✓ (user chooses `fire-first` vs `interact`)
- Minimal ✓ (single new primitive)
- Logic-agnostic ✓
- Local behavior ✗ (relies on global ordering)

### Solution 3: Conditional Constellations (Layered Evaluation)

**Idea:** Allow constellations to be structured hierarchically, with "fallback" semantics.

**Syntax:**

```stellogen
(:= classify
  (try [(-classify X negative) || (< X 0)]
   or  [(-classify X zero) || (== X 0)]
   or  [(-classify X positive) || (> X 0)]))
```

Or with syntactic sugar:

```stellogen
(:= classify {
  [(-classify X negative) || (< X 0)]
  | [(-classify X zero) || (== X 0)]
  | [(-classify X positive) || (> X 0)]})
```

**Semantics:**

- Try the first star
- If it matches, commit and return
- If it doesn't match, try the next
- Continue until one matches or all fail

**Pros:**
- Natural if-then-else feel
- Explicit structure (not relying on implicit order)
- Composable (can nest)

**Cons:**
- Adds new syntax/semantics
- Moves away from "unordered sets"
- Requires defining "match" vs "succeed"

**Alignment with philosophy:** ✓ Good

- Explicit control ✓ (structure is explicit)
- Minimal ✓ (one new construct)
- Logic-agnostic ✓
- Local behavior ✓ (local structure, not global order)

### Solution 4: Negation as Constraint (Not Cut-Based)

**Idea:** Instead of using cut for negation, use explicit negation constraints.

**Syntax:**

```stellogen
(macro (not Test)
  (interact @#Test #failure-check))

(:= failure-check {
  [(+anything) fail]})

' Or more directly:
(:= not-member {
  [(-not-member X L) (+member X L) fail]
  [(-not-member X L) ok]})
```

**Current approach in Stellogen:** Express negation through constraints:

```stellogen
' Check that X is not in list
(:= check-not-in {
  [(-check X []) ok]
  [(-check X [X|_]) fail]
  [(-check X [Y|T]) (+check X T) || (!= X Y)]})
```

**Pros:**
- No cut needed
- Declarative
- Fits Stellogen's constraint model

**Cons:**
- Less efficient than cut-based negation
- Requires careful design to avoid infinite loops

**Alignment with philosophy:** ✓ Excellent

- Explicit control ✓
- Minimal ✓ (uses existing primitives)
- Logic-agnostic ✓
- Local behavior ✓

### Solution 5: Unique/Deterministic Mode (Type-Level Control)

**Idea:** Use type-level or mode annotations to declare that a constellation should be deterministic.

**Syntax:**

```stellogen
(:= max {
  @deterministic
  [(-max X Y X) || (>= X Y)]
  [(-max X Y Y)]})
```

**Semantics:**

- Compiler/runtime ensures only one star matches
- If multiple stars match, error or warning
- Forces user to write mutually exclusive conditions

**Example:**

```stellogen
(:= classify {
  @deterministic
  [(-classify X negative) || (< X 0)]
  [(-classify X zero) || (== X 0)]
  [(-classify X positive) || (> X 0)]})

' Compiler verifies: for any X, exactly one star matches
```

**Pros:**
- Declarative intent
- Catches errors at compile-time
- Doesn't change runtime semantics

**Cons:**
- Requires analysis (may be undecidable)
- Only works for statically verifiable patterns
- Doesn't help when you WANT priority/ordering

**Alignment with philosophy:** ✓ Good

- Explicit control ✓ (declare intent)
- Minimal ✓ (annotation, not new primitive)
- Logic-agnostic ✓
- Local behavior ✓

### Solution 6: User-Level Macros (Encode Cut-Like Behavior)

**Idea:** Let users implement their own control flow using macros and constellations.

**Example - First-match macro:**

```stellogen
(macro (first-match Name Cases)
  (:= Name {
    (expand-cases-with-flags Cases)}))

' Usage:
(first-match classify
  (case (< X 0) negative)
  (case (== X 0) zero)
  (case (> X 0) positive))

' Expands to:
(:= classify {
  [(-classify X negative) || (< X 0) (+mark-used classify)]
  [(-classify X zero) (-unused classify) || (== X 0) (+mark-used classify)]
  [(-classify X positive) (-unused classify) || (> X 0)]
  [(+unused classify)]})
```

**Semantics:**
- Each case marks itself as used
- Subsequent cases require the "unused" flag
- First matching case consumes the flag

**Pros:**
- No language changes needed
- Users can experiment with different patterns
- Demonstrates Stellogen's metaprogramming power

**Cons:**
- Complex to implement correctly
- Verbose
- May be inefficient

**Alignment with philosophy:** ✓ Excellent

- Explicit control ✓
- Minimal ✓ (no language changes)
- Logic-agnostic ✓
- User-driven ✓

## Recommendation

### The Core Question

**Do we need cut-like behavior in Stellogen?**

The answer depends on the goals:

1. **If the goal is to reproduce all Prolog programs:** Yes, we need something like cut
2. **If the goal is to be a powerful logic-agnostic language:** Maybe not—different control mechanisms may be sufficient
3. **If the goal is to stay minimal and true to Stellogen's philosophy:** Probably not—add explicit control mechanisms instead

### Recommended Approach: Multi-Layered Solution

Rather than adding a single "cut" primitive, provide **multiple mechanisms** at different levels:

#### Level 1: User-Level Patterns (No Changes)

**Encourage users to encode control flow explicitly:**

```stellogen
' Determinism via mutually exclusive guards
(:= classify {
  [(-classify X negative) || (< X 0)]
  [(-classify X zero) || (== X 0)]
  [(-classify X positive) || (> X 0)]})

' First-match via flags (user-defined pattern)
(:= classify-first {
  [(+available)]
  [(-classify X negative) (-available) || (< X 0)]
  [(-classify X zero) (-available) || (== X 0)]
  [(-classify X positive) (-available)]})
```

**Pros:**
- No language changes
- Users learn to think in Stellogen's model
- Demonstrates expressiveness

**Cons:**
- Verbose
- Not obvious to newcomers
- Potential performance issues

#### Level 2: Add Conditional/Ordered Structures (Minimal Change)

**Add one new construct for ordered alternatives:**

```stellogen
(:= classify (cond
  [(< X 0) negative]
  [(== X 0) zero]
  [(> X 0) positive]))

' Desugars to:
(:= classify {
  [(-classify X negative) || (< X 0)]
  [(-classify X zero) (-classify-tried negative) || (== X 0)]
  [(-classify X positive) (-classify-tried negative) (-classify-tried zero) || (> X 0)]
  [(+classify-tried negative)]
  [(+classify-tried zero)]})
```

Or more directly, introduce `|` separator for alternatives:

```stellogen
(:= classify {
  [(-classify X negative) || (< X 0)]
  | [(-classify X zero) || (== X 0)]
  | [(-classify X positive) || (> X 0)]})
```

**Semantics:** Stars separated by `|` are tried in order; first match commits.

**Pros:**
- Explicit syntax for ordered alternatives
- Optional (users can still use unordered sets)
- Relatively simple semantics

**Cons:**
- Adds new syntax
- Moves away from "unordered sets" principle

#### Level 3: Standard Library Patterns (Documentation)

**Document common patterns in MilkyWay standard library:**

```stellogen
' lib/control.sg

''' Deterministic if-then-else '''
(macro (if Cond Then Else)
  (interact
    { [(+cond) @#Then]
      [(-cond) @#Else] }
    @#Cond))

''' First match from multiple options '''
(macro (first-of Options)
  (:= temp {
    [(+available)]
    @(expand-with-guards #Options)
  }))

' Usage:
(if (< x 0)
  (classify negative)
  (classify positive))
```

**Pros:**
- No language changes
- Educational (teaches patterns)
- Community-driven evolution

**Cons:**
- Patterns may be inefficient
- Still verbose for common cases

### Concrete Recommendation

**For Stellogen's current state (research language):**

1. **Document the limitation**: Clearly explain in docs that Stellogen cannot reproduce cut and why
2. **Document patterns**: Show how to achieve similar effects using:
   - Mutually exclusive guards
   - Fire vs interact
   - User-defined flag patterns
3. **Consider Level 2**: Add ordered alternatives (`|` separator) as a minimal extension
4. **Defer other solutions**: Wait for real-world usage to drive further changes

**Rationale:**

- Maintains Stellogen's minimalist philosophy
- Gives users explicit control
- Doesn't commit to a particular control flow model
- Allows experimentation with patterns
- Can evolve based on user needs

## Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

1. **Cut is essential to Prolog** for determinism, efficiency, negation, and control flow
2. **Stellogen cannot reproduce cut** due to fundamental architectural differences:
   - Unordered constellations vs ordered clauses
   - No backtracking vs backtracking search
   - Interaction-based vs sequential evaluation
3. **Stellogen has different control mechanisms**:
   - Explicit focus (`@`)
   - Linear vs non-linear interaction (`fire` vs `interact`)
   - Process chaining
   - Inequality constraints
4. **Several solutions exist** that align with Stellogen's philosophy to varying degrees

### The Fundamental Trade-Off

**Prolog's approach:**
- Implicit control (automatic backtracking)
- Sequential evaluation (ordered clauses)
- Cut for explicit commitment

**Stellogen's approach:**
- Explicit control (user chooses evaluation mode)
- Parallel/unordered evaluation (constellations)
- No global commitment mechanism

**These represent different points in the design space.** Neither is strictly superior—they embody different philosophies:

| Philosophy | Prolog | Stellogen |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| **Control** | Implicit (automatic search) | Explicit (user-driven) |
| **Ordering** | Implicit (clause order) | Explicit (if needed) |
| **Commitment** | Explicit (cut) | Implicit (interaction) |
| **Paradigm** | Logic programming | Logic-agnostic |

### Is This a Problem?

**No, it's a feature.**

Stellogen's inability to reproduce cut is not a bug—it's a consequence of its design philosophy:

> Elementary interactive building blocks where both computation and meaning live in the same language.

Stellogen gives up Prolog's automatic search and backtracking in favor of:
- **Explicit control**: Users control evaluation
- **Polarity**: Computation driven by complementary terms
- **Flexibility**: Not committed to any paradigm

This is a **conscious trade-off**, not a deficiency.

### Recommended Path Forward

1. **Document the difference**: Explain why cut doesn't exist and why that's okay
2. **Provide patterns**: Show how to achieve similar effects
3. **Consider minimal extensions**: If needed, add ordered alternatives (`|`)
4. **Let patterns emerge**: See what users actually need before adding more

### Final Thought

Prolog's cut is powerful because it gives control within Prolog's implicit search model. Stellogen doesn't need cut because it gives control through **explicit interaction modes**.

The question isn't "How do we add cut to Stellogen?" but rather:

> **"What control flow patterns do users need, and how can we provide them while staying true to Stellogen's philosophy of explicit, local, elementary interactions?"**

The answer will emerge through experimentation and real-world usage.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Prolog Cut Variants

Different Prolog implementations have variations on cut:

- **Green cut**: Cut that doesn't change the declarative meaning (only efficiency)
- **Red cut**: Cut that changes declarative meaning (affects correctness)
- **Soft cut** (`*->`): Commits to clause but allows backtracking within the clause
- **If-then-else** (`->`): Built-in conditional with implicit cut

### Appendix B: Alternative Control Mechanisms in Other Languages

- **Mercury**: Mode and determinism declarations (compile-time)
- **Curry**: Committed choice via `(&)` operator
- **Lolli**: Linear logic removes backtracking through resource consumption
- **Mercury**: `commit` goal for explicit commitment
- **Prolog II**: `freeze` for delayed evaluation

### Appendix C: Stellogen Examples

**Example 1: Max without cut-like behavior:**

```stellogen
(:= max {
  [(-max X Y X) || (>= X Y)]
  [(-max X Y Y) || (< X Y)]})

' Both guards are mutually exclusive, so only one matches
```

**Example 2: First-match pattern:**

```stellogen
(:= first-match {
  [(+available)]
  [(-try option1) (-available) (+result option1)]
  [(-try option2) (-available) (+result option2)]
  [(-try option3) (-available) (+result option3)]})

' Only first matching option consumes the available flag
```

**Example 3: Conditional execution:**

```stellogen
(:= conditional {
  [(-if-then-else) (-test) (+test-succeeded) (+then)]
  [(-if-then-else) (-test) (+test-failed) (+else)]
  [(+test-failed) (-test-succeeded)]})
```
