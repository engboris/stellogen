# The Stellogen Kernel

This document is the kernel specification: an exhaustive list of every
form the language accepts, with its exact semantics.

**Normativity.** The specification is written in language-level terms
only; the implementation conforms to it, not the other way around. Where
the implementation and this document disagree, one of them has a bug.

The kernel rule: **if a feature can be defined as a macro, it must not be
in the kernel; if it cannot and is not essential, it does not belong in
the language.**

The kernel has two parts with deliberately different semantics:

- The **object kernel** (part I): stellar resolution proper. Terms, rays,
  stars, constellations, focus, constraints, and the fusion dynamics.
  Unordered, interactive, possibly non-terminating. Anything that
  computes lives here.
- The **meta kernel** (part II): the functional glue that assembles
  constellations, runs them, and compares the results. Deterministic and
  ordered. It never computes anything itself.

The sorting rule between them: **anything that computes belongs in the
object language; a meta construct must justify itself as glue (assemble,
run, compare).**

Everything above these two layers (notation macros, checkers, logics,
type disciplines) is user space, written in ordinary `.sg` files.
`sgen preprocess` is the witness: run it on any file and what remains is
kernel forms only.

Part III specifies the code-as-term encoding, the contract for checkers
that inspect code as data. Part IV specifies the base observations and
the judgment contract.

## Part I: the object kernel

### 1.1 Terms

Lexical rules:

- A token starting with an uppercase letter or `_` is a **variable**
  (`X`, `Result`, `_Tail`). The bare token `_` is a wildcard: each
  occurrence stands for a fresh variable.
- Any other token is a **symbol** (`a`, `bob`, `0`, `s`, `+add`, `%cons`).
  Symbols may contain any characters except whitespace, the delimiters
  `( ) [ ] { }`, and `|`; they may not start with `'`, `"`, `@` or `#`.
- `' ...` is a line comment, `''' ... '''` a block comment.
- `"chars"` is a string literal with escapes `\n \t \\ \"`.

Grammar of terms:

```
term ::= VAR                    variable, local to its star
       | sym                    constant (0-ary function)
       | (sym term ...)         function application
       | [term ...]             sugar: cons list (%cons/%nil, see part III)
       | [term ... | term]      sugar: cons list with explicit tail
       | "chars"                sugar: (%string chars)
```

The head of an application must be a symbol; a variable in head position
is an error, as is the empty application `()`.

### 1.2 Rays and polarity

A symbol whose first character is `+` or `-` is a **polarized** symbol;
the polarity is not part of the name, so `+add`, `-add` and `add` share
the name `add` with polarities positive, negative, neutral.

A **ray** is a term used as an interaction point of a star. Two function
symbols are **compatible** when they have the same name and dual
polarities (`+`/`-`), or are both neutral. Two rays can fuse when they are
unifiable under this compatibility relation and both are polarized.

Precisely:

1. **Duality applies pointwise at every depth.** Unification descends
   through subterms with the same compatibility test, so `(+f (+g a))`
   unifies with `(-f (-g a))`, not with `(-f (+g a))`. Polarized symbols
   inside arguments must also invert.
2. **A ray is polarized when a polarized symbol occurs anywhere in it**,
   at any depth. A neutral-headed ray with a polarized subterm is
   therefore eligible for fusion.

### 1.3 Stars and constraints

A **star** is a finite block of rays, optionally with constraints:

```
star ::= ray
       | [ray ...]
       | [ray ... || ban ...]

ban  ::= (!= term term)         inequality
       | (slice term term)      incompatibility
```

Variables are **local to each star**. Before each fusion the two stars are
renamed apart, so no variable is ever shared between two stars.

Constraints restrict fusion. After a fusion, the merged star's constraints
are checked for coherence; an incoherent fusion is discarded, producing no
star:

- `(!= t1 t2)` is violated when the two terms have become syntactically
  equal.
- `(slice box s)` is violated when two `slice` constraints share an equal
  first component but differ on the second. It forces all `slice`
  assignments to the same box to agree.

### 1.4 Constellations and focus

A **constellation** is a finite multiset of stars. Focus (`@`) marks the
distinction that drives execution:

```
cell  ::= star | @star
const ::= cell | { cell ... } | @{ cell ... }
```

- A star marked `@` is a **state**: part of the data being transformed.
- An unmarked star is an **action**: a rule that transforms states.

`@` on a group focuses every star inside, hereditarily: focus strips all
marks and re-marks everything as state, so `@` is idempotent and
distributes through `{...}`.

Constellations are unordered as far as the semantics is concerned; the
implementation keeps them in some order, and observable orderings
(printing, `==`) reflect that order without it being part of the
specification. See section 4.1.

### 1.5 Execution

Execution is **one operation**: saturation of a focused interaction space.
Its two surface variants differ along one axis, and staging is not a
variant at all:

- **Mode axis: the structural discipline of action stars.** Actions enjoy
  weakening in every mode: actions left unused are discarded (the result
  of an execution consists of the final state stars only). `exec`
  additionally grants contraction: an action can be copied and used any
  number of times, as if under `!`. `fire` grants no contraction: once an
  action star fuses it is removed from the action pool (if one scan finds
  several alternative fusions of the same action, all their results are
  kept as branches, but the action is consumed).
- **Staging is derived notation.** `(then c1 c2 ...)` is a left fold of
  executions, elaborated away before evaluation (part II); it never
  touches the execution engine.

Operationally, execution proceeds as follows:

1. Split the input constellation into actions and states by their mark.
2. Scan the states. For a state star having a polarized ray that admits at
   least one fusion against some action ray: perform **all** fusions of
   that one ray (against every compatible ray of every action), remove the
   state star, and add the fused stars to the states. In linear mode,
   remove every action consumed by these fusions.
3. A **fusion** of a state star and an action star along compatible rays
   `r` and `r'`: rename the two stars apart, unify `r` with `r'`, drop the
   matched pair, apply the substitution to the remaining rays of both
   stars, and merge them (with their constraints) into one new star.
   Discard the result if its constraints are incoherent (1.3).
4. Repeat until no state star can interact (saturation). Empty stars are
   dropped. The final states are the result; remaining actions are
   discarded.

The order in which states and candidate fusions are picked is
implementation-determined and not part of the specification; only the
saturation semantics is.

The result of `exec`/`fire` is re-marked as all-action (unfocused), which
is why chaining requires re-focusing; `then` does exactly that.

Execution may diverge; that is a property of the object language,
accepted. Termination guarantees are user-space theorems about restricted
fragments, not kernel features.

### 1.6 What is not in the object kernel

No numbers or arithmetic, no booleans or conditionals, no strings as
anything but term sugar, no ordering of stars, no notion of function call,
no record system (the fields idiom, a `(+field k) v` star plus a `get`
macro, is a user-space pattern and stays one), no module or scope
construct. Symbols are global addresses: any two constellations sharing a
function symbol with opposite polarities can interact when placed in one
space, and curating interaction spaces is the user's job, done at the meta
level. Hygiene exists only for variables, which are per-star. All of the
above are encodings or user-space conventions.

---

## Part II: the meta kernel

The complete inventory of forms the language accepts. Any expression not
matching a form below is read as a raw term (a single-ray constellation,
or a constellation if it uses the encodings of part III).

| Form | Role | Justification as glue |
|---|---|---|
| `(def name e ...)` | bind | naming things |
| `(def (name p ...) e)` | parametric bind | naming families of things |
| `#name`, `#(name a ...)` | reference | using named things |
| `@e` | focus | marking state (shared with the object kernel) |
| `(exec e ...)` | run, with contraction | running interactions |
| `(fire e ...)` | run, linear | resource-aware variant |
| `(then e1 e2 ...)` | staged run | derived form; a fold of `exec` |
| `(show e ...)` | display | observation |
| `(== e1 e2 [msg])` | assert equal | base observation (part IV) |
| `(~= e1 e2 [msg])` | assert unifiable | base observation (part IV) |
| `(forall g X e)` | iterate over a galaxy | the one binder; the forall of orthogonality |
| `(use "path")` | import | files are files |
| `(macro (name X ...) body ...)` | fixed-arity rewrite | the tower's growth mechanism |
| `(spec name e ...)` | bind, marking intent | alias of `def`; a fixed-arity macro cannot alias a variadic form |

What is deliberately absent: closures, higher-order functions, arithmetic,
conditionals, general recursion, mutable state, `eval` (term to running
code). The meta language's only data are terms and constellations; its
only verbs are build, run, compare.

### 2.1 `def` and `#`

`(def name e)` binds `name` to the **unevaluated** expression `e`.
References evaluate at use site (call by name): `#x` where `x` is bound to
`(exec ...)` re-runs the execution at every reference.

`(def name e1 e2 ...)` with several values builds a **galaxy**. If every
value is a `{...}` group, each group becomes one galaxy member and each
member is evaluated **eagerly**, at definition time. Otherwise the values
are wrapped into a single group (one member, call by name as above).
Galaxies are the domain of `forall`; in an `exec`, a galaxy flattens into
the union of its members.

Identifiers are rays, so definitions can be parametric:
`(def (pair X Y) ...)` binds the key `(pair X Y)`; the reference
`#(pair a b)` unifies against stored keys and applies the resulting
substitution to the stored expression. Binding a key that unifies with an
existing key replaces that binding.

`(spec ...)` is accepted wherever `def` is and behaves identically; it
marks the intent that the defined thing is a test suite. It is a kernel
form rather than a macro because `def` is variadic (galaxy formation) and
macros are fixed-arity: no macro can faithfully alias it.

### 2.2 `exec`, `fire`, `then`

`(exec e1 ... en)` evaluates its arguments, combines them into one
constellation (groups and galaxies flatten), and saturates it as in 1.5
with contraction; `(fire ...)` does the same without contraction. The
result is an unfocused constellation.

`(then c1 c2 ... cn)` is elaborated at read time into a left fold:
`(then a b)` becomes `@(exec b @a)`, and each further step executes
against the previous result focused as state. It exists because ordering
runs is glue that fixed-arity macros cannot express variadically; it is
only special in head position (`then` remains an ordinary symbol inside
terms).

### 2.3 `forall`

`(forall g X e)` evaluates the reference `g`, splits the result into
galaxy members (a non-galaxy value is a singleton), and evaluates `e` once
per member with `X` bound to that member. `X` must be written as a
variable but is bound as an ordinary identifier (so `e` refers to it as
`#X`). Each iteration runs in a local environment; bindings made inside
the body do not escape, and tests run in separate interaction spaces. A
**member** is precisely: one immediate group of a multi-group `def`
(2.1), or the whole value otherwise.

`forall` is kernel, not user space: it iterates over galaxy structure
unknown at macro-expansion time, so no fixed-arity macro can express it.
It is the "for all tests e in E" of orthogonality, which is why checking
macros are built on it.

### 2.4 `show`, `use`

`(show e ...)` evaluates each argument and prints the resulting
constellations, space-separated, in the surface syntax.

`(use "path")` (or `(use sym)`, which appends `.sg`) resolves the path
**relative to the importing file**, parses it, and (a) brings its macros
into scope during preprocessing, (b) evaluates its program into the
current environment, importing definitions. One form imports both;
circular imports are detected and rejected.

### 2.5 `macro`

`(macro (name X1 ... Xn) body ...)` defines a rewrite with **fixed
arity**. Arguments must be variables. One name may carry several patterns
of different arities; a call expands the pattern whose arity matches
exactly. Expansion order: arguments are expanded first, substituted into
the body, and the result is expanded again. Macros expand before
kernel-form recognition, so a macro whose head and arity collide with a
kernel form shadows it; do not do this.

There are no variadic patterns and no computation in patterns; the macro
layer is spelling, not evaluation. Expansion terminates if and only if
macro references are acyclic: a macro whose expansion mentions itself,
directly or mutually, makes preprocessing diverge. Acyclicity is an
obligation on the user; under it the meta language is total, and every
file's elaboration halts (only object-level interaction may diverge).

---

## Part III: the code-as-term encoding

Every surface expression is a first-order term; this section makes the
encoding a **contract**. Shape checkers unify against these shapes, so the
encoding must stay stable; changing it is a breaking change to every
checker in user space.

The `%`-prefixed names below, plus `@`, `#`, `!=` and `slice` in encoded
positions, are reserved for the encoding.

### 3.1 Surface syntax to terms (read time)

```
[a b c]            -> (%cons a (%cons b (%cons c %nil)))     lists
[h | t]            -> (%cons h t)
"chars"            -> (%string chars)
{e1 ... en}        -> (%group e1' ... en')                   groups
[r1 ... || b ...]  -> (%params RAYLIST BANLIST)              star with bans
                      RAYLIST a %cons list of rays; BANLIST a %cons list
                      of ("!=" t1 t2) / ("slice" t1 t2) terms
#e                 -> ("#" e')                               reference marker
@e                 -> ("@" e')                               focus marker
(f a ...)          -> (f a' ...)                             applications are themselves
```

Every surface form embeds in term position: `@`, `#` and `{...}` occurring
inside a term become plain `"@"`-, `"#"`- and `%group`-headed subterms.
This is what lets a macro splice one body into both code position and term
position; no `quote` primitive is needed, and a `quote` notation, if ever
added, is a user-space no-op marker over this encoding.

### 3.2 Constellations to terms (run time)

Evaluation results are terms in the same vocabulary, and the language
reads them back by the same rules:

```
action star [r1 ... rn]   -> (%cons r1 (... (%cons rn %nil)))
star with bans            -> (%params RAYLIST BANLIST)
  ban (!= t1 t2)          -> ("!=" t1 t2), in a %cons list
  ban (slice t1 t2)       -> ("slice" t1 t2), in a %cons list
state star                -> ("@" STAR)
constellation, one star   -> STAR              (not wrapped)
constellation, n stars    -> (%group S1 ... Sn)
galaxy                    -> (%galaxy T1 ... Tn)
```

Reading back: `%galaxy` and `%group` flatten and concatenate; `"@"`
focuses its contents; a `%cons` list of rays is an action star; any other
term is a single-ray action star. Ray polarities ride inside these terms
as ordinary polarized symbols.

---

## Part IV: base observations and the judgment contract

Typing in Stellogen is user-defined: a checking macro is a practice
declaring its orthogonality relation. Trust cannot be tests all the way
down, so the kernel fixes exactly two **base observations**, plus the
binder `forall` (2.3). They are the only trusted judges; everything else
is spelling above them.

### 4.1 `==` : syntactic equality of results

`(== e1 e2)` evaluates both sides, converts both to constellations, strips
focus marks, and compares **syntactically**: same stars with the same rays
and the same constraints, in the same order, with the same variable names.
No unification, no reordering, no renaming. Consequences: `==` is
focus-blind; it is order-sensitive, so it compares the order the
implementation produced (fix the expected constellation from an actual
run, or compare single-star results); and it is name-sensitive on
variables.

On failure the program aborts, reporting both sides and the source
location. An optional third argument replaces the default message.

### 4.2 `~=` : polarity-blind structural unifiability

`(~= e1 e2)` evaluates both sides and succeeds when **some ray of the
first unifies with some ray of the second after all polarities are
normalized away**. Polarity is ignored at every depth: `(~= (+f X)
(+f a))` succeeds. The check is existential over rays, not a matching of
whole constellations. Failure aborts with a report of both sides;
optional third argument as above.

### 4.3 The judgment contract

**A checking macro must expand to assertions**, that is, bottom out in
`==` or `~=` (usually under `forall`). Assertions are the only way
anything reports pass or fail, so generic tooling counts failures
identically across all practices, whatever their success conventions:
an `ok` residue, annihilation (empty residue), witness shapes, linear
checking via `fire`. A typical practice defines its type assertion as

```stellogen
(macro (:: Tested Test)
  (forall Test T
    (== @(exec @#Tested #T) ok)))
```

and this is user space, not a kernel form: each practice declares its own
orthogonality relation this way, and all of them rest on the same two
trusted observations.
